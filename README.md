# Front-end developer test

Objective:
----------
Create a front-end CRUD application to manage books on a bookshelf, using this application as the back-end.

The application is deployed, the API endpoints ready to access at the following base URL:
https://react-test-globacap.herokuapp.com/

We would especially like to see your approach to coding, use of any stylesheet languages such as Sass or LESS, or anything else you think is relevant.

This test should take around 2 hours.

Send us a link in Github and/or a working deployed version of your front-end application.
